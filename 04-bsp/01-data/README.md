# Data Requirements

- Want to chart the lagged update of the BSP projection so need multiple timepoints
- Also don't want to go too crazy with data volumes
- Probably don't need 12 months of data maybe only 3 months
- Maybe I'll take 3 months of thoroughbred data
- I'll take 5 second updates from the point of 30 seconds before scheduled off until the off
- Might split out metadata into seperate table again
