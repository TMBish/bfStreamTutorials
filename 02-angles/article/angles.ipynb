    "Formulating betting angles (or \"strategies\" as some call them) is quite a common pasttime for some. These angles can range all the way from very simple to quite sophisticated, and could include things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Betting against an AFL team coming of the bye who are playing against a team who played last week\n",
    "* Backing a greyhound in boxes 1 or 2 in short sprint style races\n",
    "* Backing a horse pre-race who typically runs at the front of the field and placing an order to lay the same horse if it shortens to some lower price in-play, locking in a profit\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the complexity of the actual concept what really seperates these angles is evidence and rigour. You might have heard many TV personalities or betting ads suggest a certain strategy (resembling one of the above) are real-world predictive trends but rarely are they derived from the right historical data or concluded with the necessary statistical rigour. Most simply formulated their angles off intuition or observing a trend across a relatively small sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There **are** many users on betting exchanges who profit off these angles. In fact, when most people talk about automated or sophisticated exchange betting they are often talking about automating these kind of betting angles, rather than sophisticated bottom-up fundemental modelling. That's because profitable fundemental modelling (where your model which arrives at some estimation of fair value from first principles) is very hard.\n",
