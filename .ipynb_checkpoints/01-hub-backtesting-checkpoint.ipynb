    "Backtesting is the life-blood of most succesful wagering systems. In short it attempts to answer a single question for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ \\tau $ : How much money will I win or lose if I started using this system to place bets with real money? \n",
    "\n",
    "Without a rigorous and quantitative backtesting approach it's really quite hard to estimate the answer to this question $ \\tau $ that will be even reliably on the right side of zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could live test your system with real bets at small stakes, however, this isn't the panacea it seems. It will take time (more than you think) for your results to converge to their long term expectation. How long? Answering this question will require some expertise with probability and statistics you might not have. Even more than that though is that depending on where you're betting your results at small stakes could be very different than at larger stakes. You might not be able get a good answer to $ \\tau $ until betting at full stakes at which point finding the answer might coincide with blowing up your gambling bankroll.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtesting is also very hard. To perfectly backtest your own predicted probablility on a historical race or sporting match you need to produce 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) What would my predicted chance have been **exactly** for this selection in this market on this day in the past?\n",
    "\n",
    "> (2) What would have I decided to bet **at what odds (exactly)** and **for how much stake (exactly)** based on this prediction? \n",
    "\n",
    "The devil in the detail of backtesting tends to be in those exactlys. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the backtesting game is answering (2) as accurately as possible because it tells you exactly how much you would have made over your backtesting period, from there you can confidently project that rate of profitability forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to make mistakes and small errors in the quantitative reasoning can lead you to extremely misguided projections downstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question (1) won't be in the scope of this notebook but it's equally (and probably more) important thant (2) but it is the key challenge of all predictive modelling exercises so there's plenty of discussion about it elsewhere."

    "\n",
    "Answering quistion (2) for betting on the betfair exchange is difficult. The exhange is a dynamic system that changes from one micro second to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What number should you use for odds? How much could you assume to get down at those odds?\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional and easiest approach is to backtest at the BSP. The BSP is simple because it's a single number (to use for both back and lay bets) and is a taken price (there's no uncertainty about getting matched). Depending on the liquidity of the market a resonably sized stake might also not move the BSP very much. For some markets you may be able to safely assume you could be $10s of dollars at the BSP without moving it an inch. However, that's definitely not true of all BSP markets and you need to be generally aware that your betfair orders in the future **will** change the state of the exchange, and large bets **will** move the BSP in an unfavourable direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from uncertainty around the liquidity and resiliance of the BSP, many many markets don't have a BSP. So what do we do then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically what a lot of people (who have a relationship with betfair australia) do at this point is request a data dump. They might request an odds file for all australian harness race win markets since june 2018 with results and 4 different price points: the BSP, the last traded price, the weighted average price (WAP) traded in 3 minutes before the race starts, and the WAP for all bets matched prior to 3 mins before the race. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you will likely need to be an existing VIP customer to get this file and it's not a perfect solution: it might take 2 weeks to get, you can't refresh it, you can't test more hypothetical price points after your initial analysis amongst many other problems. \n",

With these ratings we're fine but generally we should just be aware there are some sketchy services that might make retroactive adjustments to historical ratings to juice their performance which obviously violates 1.\n",

    "Further, and from experience, if you placing bets at the BSP and you're using some form of proportional staking (like kelly) then you're calculated stake size will need to include a quantity (the BSP) which you will literally never be 100% sure of. You'll need to estimate the BSP as close to market suspension as you can and place your BSP bets with a stake sized derived from that estimation. This imprecision in stake calculation WILL cost you some profit relative to your backtested expectation. \n",
